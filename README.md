AUTHENTICATION NOTES
0. Whenever a user first authenticates, a tracking user account is created in 
MarkLogic and is given 'user' privs.

2. Authentication is done via OAuth2 and comes configured by default
to support a sample facebook and github applications.  These apps
are also configured to assume the OAuth2 redirect should go to http://localhost:8100

3. You should create your own github or facebook application if you want
authentication to be secure.
